"""
    This module contains all the paths for alls this project's directories,
    that we created dynamically.

    All paths are absolute, without symlink and in unicode.

    We also add the 'apps' and 'libs' directories to the PYTHON PATH, which
    will make the imports much  easier.

# it renders it completely portable since all directory paths are dynamically
# generated instead of being hard coded.

# We get the 'settings.py' file path (the __FILE__ variable contains
# automatically the path of the current file) and we transform this string
# to unicode in case you got non ASCII characters in this name (
# sys.getfilesystemencoding() get us the file system encoding which can be
# different for Windows, Mac or Linux)

# We add the apps and libs directory to the PYTHON PATH, so we can import each
# package without prefixing them with the parent package name. This mimic the
# behavior we would have if they were at the root directory or installed with
# pip.
#
# E.G: we can do from "app1_hello.views import hello" instead of
#      "from apps.app1_hello.views import hello" or "import django" instead of
#      "from libs import django"
#
# When you have a small project, you can avoid this and put all apps at the root
# dir like in the official Django tutorial, but in a big project with a lots of
# apps, you usually put them all in an "apps" dir like we did, so it's a good
# thing to know.
